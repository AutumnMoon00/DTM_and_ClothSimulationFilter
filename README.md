# DTM_and_ClothSimulationFilter
Given the input of point cloud, 
 - the code can thin the dataset 
 - Filter the ground from non-ground points (Cloth Simulation Filter)
 - Create a triangulated DTM from the extracted ground points, and 
 - Finally isolines are generated for visualization. 
 
 Code is developed for AHN3 dataset, small modifications might be required for other datasets.

## Implementation
For implementing the code, navigate to code directory and follow the instructions in readme.txt.
 - For visualization of the same please navigate to CSF_Visualization_Video_and_Code directory and follow the instructions in the previous step, feel free to play with parameters.
